The git of Expand's Game. It is a strategic based game for android (mayb ios)
The game will be a top down 3d strategic game where you can create different type of unit, select them, and leading them to battle.
Each Level is a island that you have to conquer/defend depending to the mission.
There is for now 3 type of unit :
-Infantry: polyvalent, great for defending, can force nearby enemy to attack them
-Archer : weak in melee but can give a great support to other troops with their long range, can boost their attack speed to fire more arrow
-Cavalry : fast and deadly, their first strike deal massive damage but do not let them on melee for to long
